% \subsection{Graph-based Representation}
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have been introduced in the Semantic Web community to create the ``Web of data" that can be readable by machines. They represent interlinked collections of factual information, which are often encoded using the RDF data model \cite{rdf2004}. This data model represents the content of the graph with a set of triples of the form $\tuple{\mi{subject\;predicate\;object}}$ corresponding to positive binary and unary first-order logic (FOL) facts. For encyclopedic KGs on the semantic web, usually the open world assumption (OWA) is employed, i.e., these graphs contain only a subset of the true information. % are large collections of information modeled in the form of entities (such as people, organizations, or places) and the relationships between them.
%KGs %were 
%is
%can be . % This was pushed forward by introducing the W3C Resource Description Framework (RDF)~\cite{rdf2004}.
%Under this representation, the entities are encoded as the nodes of the graph and the relations as directed edges between them
%~\cite{Nickel2015ARO}. 
%In various literature, for simplicity KGs are represented as sets of triples in the form of $\tuple{subject, predicate, object}$ (SPO triples, for short). Alternatively, others adopt a factual representation for which a KG $\cG$ is defined over the signature $\Sigma_{\cG}=\tuple{\cR,\cC}$, where $\cR$ is the set of binary predicates (aka relations) and $\cC$  is the set of constants (aka entities) appearing in $\cG$.

\begin{example} Figure~\ref{rdf} shows a snippet of a graph about people, marriage %their 
relations between them %to each other and 
their %places of 
living places. For instance, the upper half encodes the information that ``Ann has bother john, and lives with her husband Brad in Berlin, which is a metropolitan.''. 
%while her brother John lives in Chicago with his wife Kate. Moreover, both Berlin and Chicago are metropolitans'', which %would also 
is % also 
represented as the set of FOL facts $\mi{\{hasBrother(ann, john), livesIn(ann, berlin)}$, $\mi{livesIn(brad, berlin)}$,\\ $\mi{isMarriedTo(brad, ann)}$
% $\mi{hasBrother(ann, john)}$, \\$\mi{livesIn(john, chicago)}$, $\mi{livesIn(kate, chicago)} \}$, $\mi{isMarriedTo(john, kate)}$,
$\mi{metropolitan(berlin)}\}$.  \qed
\end{example}
%\begin{example}
%The statement \textit{``Christopher Nolan is the director of the science fiction movie Interstellar, which won the Best Visual Effects Oscar"} will be represented in several SPO triples:\\
%$\tuple{chris\_nolan, isA, director}$,\\
%$\tuple{chris\_nolan, directed, interstellar}$,\\
%$\tuple{interstellar, gerne, science\_fiction}$, and \\
%$\tuple{interstellar, wonPrize, visual\_effects\_oscar}$.
%\end{example}





%about people, organizations, places, etc. Predicates encodes the relations between them, \eg $\tuple{einstein, wasBornIn, Ulm}$. KGs can also be represented similar to formal logic syntax as binary predicate $p(s,o)$, where $subject$ and $object$ are the arguments. KGs can be seen as instantiations for some ontological schema.

\subsection{Knowledge Graphs Construction and Quality}
\input{tables/kg_sizes}
KGs are constructed either manually or automatically. Manually constructed KGs are either curated by a closed group of experts, %as for 
e.g., WordNet~\cite{wordnet} or collaboratively by volunteers, 
%such as 
e.g., Freebase~\cite{Freebase} and Wikidata~\cite{wikidata}.  Nevertheless, there is extensive work for automatically populating KGs from semi-structured resources such as Wikipedia info-boxes using regular expressions and other heuristics and constraints as in YAGO~\cite{yago} and DBpedia~\cite{dbpedia}. More eager approaches propose extracting facts from unstructured resources using natural language processing and machine learning techniques; resulting in KGs such as  NELL~\cite{nell}, KnowledgeVault~\cite{KnowledgeVault}. Table~\ref{tab:kgs}, shows examples for several available KGs (extended discussions can be found in~\cite{Nickel2015ARO,DBLP:journals/semweb/Paulheim17}). 

%\gad{should we speak about the sizes and scalability of existing approaches}\ds{reporting statistics is enough}


Both manually and automatically constructed KGs are still far from modeling the real world in two aspects: (i) they are still \textit{incomplete} with relatively \textit{low coverage} for the existing real-world entities and the possible inter-entities relationships. (ii) they have \textit{inaccurate} facts resulting from the extraction errors and the heuristic methods applied while construction as well.  



\subsection{Interpreting Knowledge Graphs under Incompleteness}

Existing KGs consist of positive facts only (\ie true relations). There are two paradigms to interpret the missing fact: (i) under \textit{closed world assumption} (CWA), in which missing edges indicate a false relationship. (ii) under open world assumption (OWA), such that non-existing relations are interpreted as unknown and can be either true or false. For example, in Figure~\ref{rdf}, the missing \textit{livesIn} link between \textit{Dave} and \textit{Chicago} would be interpreted as $\neg livesIn(dave, chicago)$ under CWA. However, under OWA, no conclusion can be made. Given the \textit{incompleteness} and \textit{inaccuracy} of the existing real-life KGs, they are usually interpreted under OWA~\cite{Nickel2015ARO}. 

To study the incompleteness of KGs, we assume the existence of an ideal graph $\cG^i$ containing a snapshot of the current world; hence, we define the incompleteness of knowledge graphs as:

\begin{definition}[Incomplete Knowledge Graph] An incomplete KG is a pair
    $G = (\cG, \cG^i)$ of two KGs, where $\cG\subseteq \cG^i$ and
    $\Sigma_{\cG}=\Sigma_{\cG^i}$. We call $\cG$ the available
    graph and $\mathcal{G}^i$ the ideal graph.  \end{definition}
    
This definition allows evaluating the proposed approaches for completing the knowledge graph.

\leanparagraph{Nonmonotonic Logic Programs} \gad{Todo: fix to binary and to fit our purpose}
We define a logic program in the usual way~\cite{DBLP:books/sp/Lloyd87}. 
In short, a \emph{(nonmonotonic) logic program} $P$ is a set of \emph{rules} of the form
\begin{equation}
H\leftarrow B, \naf\ E
\end{equation}
 where $H$ is a standard first-order atom of the form $a(\vec{X})$ known as the rule head and denoted as $\mi{Head(r)}$, $B$ is a conjunction of positive atoms of the form $b_1(\vec{Y_1}),\dotsc,b_k(\vec{Y_k})$  to which we refer as $\mi{Body^+}(r)$, and $\naf\ E$, with slight abuse of notation, denotes the conjunction of atoms $\naf\, b_{k+1}(\vec{Y_{k+1}}),\dotsc,\naf\, b_n(\vec{Y_{n}})$. Here, $\naf$ is the so-called \emph{negation as failure (NAF)} or \emph{default negation}. The negated part of the body is denoted as $\mi{Body^-}(r)$.  The rule $r$ is \emph{positive} or
\emph{Horn} if $\mi{Body^-}(r)=\emptyset$.
 $\vec{X},\vec{Y_1},\ldots,\vec{Y_{n}}$ are tuples of either constants or
variables whose length corresponds to the arity of the predicates
$a,b_1,\ldots,b_n$ respectively. The signature of $P$ is given as $\Sigma_{\mi{P}}=\tuple{\mathbf{P},\cC}$, where $\mathbf{P}$ and $\cC$ are resp. sets of predicates and constants occurring in $P$.


A logic program $P$ is \emph{ground} if it consists of only ground rules, i.e. rules without
variables. Ground instantiation $Gr(P)$ of a nonground program $P$ is obtained by substituting variables with constants in all possible ways. The \emph{Herbrand universe}  $\mi{HU(P)}$ (resp. \emph{Herbrand base} $\mi{HB(P)}$) of $\mi{P}$, is the set of all constants occurring in $\mi{P}$, i.e.  $\mi{HU(P)}=\cC$ (resp.
the set of all possible ground atoms that can be formed with predicates in $\mathbf{P}$
and constants in $\cC$). We refer to any subset of $\mi{HB(P)}$ as a \emph{Herbrand interpretation}. By $\mi{MM(P)}$ we denote the set-inclusion minimal Herbrand interpretation of a ground positive program $P$.


An interpretation $I$ of $P$ is an \emph{answer set} (or \emph{stable model}) of $P$ iff $I \in \mi{MM}(P^I)$, where $P^I$ is the \emph{Gelfond-Lifschitz (GL) reduct} \cite{GL1988} of $P$, obtained from $Gr(P)$ by removing (i) each rule $r$ such that $\mi{Body}^-(r) \cap I\neq\emptyset$, and (ii) all the negative atoms from the remaining rules. The set of answer sets of a program $P$ is denoted by $AS(P)$.

\begin{example}
Consider the program \\
{\small \leftline{$P = \left\{
            \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.1}
            \begin{array}{@{\,}l@{~~}l@{}}
              \mbox{(1) }\mi{bornInUS(alex)};\;\mbox{(2) }\mi{bornInUS(mat)};\;\mbox{(3) }\mi{immigrant(mat)};\\
              \mbox{(4) } \mi{livesInUS(X)}\leftarrow \mi{bornInUS(X)},  \naf\ \mi{immigrant(X)}\\
            \end{array}%
            \!\right\}$}}
            
\normalsize
{\smallskip

\noindent            
The ground instantiation $Gr(P)$ of $P$ is obtained by substituting $X$ with $\mi{mat}$ and ${alex}$. For $I{=}\{${\small$\mi{bornInUS(alex){,}bornInUS(mat){,}immigrant(mat){,}livesInUS(alex)}$}$\}$, the GL-reduct $P^I$ of $P$ contains the rule $\mi{livesInUS(alex)\leftarrow bornInUS(alex)}$ and the facts (1)-(3). As $I$ is a minimal model of $P^I$, it holds that $I$ is an answer set of $P$.}\qed

The answer set semantics for nonmonotonic logic programs is based on the CWA, under which whatever can not be derived from a program is assumed to be false. Nonmonotonic logic programs are widely applied for formalizing common sense reasoning from incomplete information.

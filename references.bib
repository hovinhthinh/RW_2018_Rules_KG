In particular, we use them to score candidate multi-relational association rules in an evolutionary approach to the enrichment of populated knowledge bases in the context of the Semantic Web. The evolutionary algorithm searches for hidden knowledge patterns, in the form of SWRL rules, in assertional data, while exploiting the deductive capabilities of ontologies.",
